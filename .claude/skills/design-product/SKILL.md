# /design-product

Produce a PRD for: `$ARGUMENTS`

**The second design stage.** The design doc (from `/design-initiative`) frames the problem;
this skill defines what gets delivered. The PRD is a contract between the trio (PM, EM,
Designer) and the Architect who will design the system.

## Pipeline position

```
/design-initiative → .claude/specs/design-scope.md (what we are building, why)
    ↓
/design-product → PRD (deliverables, requirements, constraints)  ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓
/design-system (Architect) → design of record + specs/*.md
    ↓
/design-roadmap → milestones, dependencies, GitHub issues
```

No system design is drawn without a PRD. No PRD is written without a design doc.

## Roles at the table

| Role | Focus | Accountable for |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **PM** | Requirements, success criteria, scope | "What must the system do?" |
| **EM** | Feasibility, quality gates, delivery plan | "What's the realistic delivery shape?" |
| **Designer** | UX requirements, accessibility, information design | "What does the user need to see, do, and understand?" |

## Inputs (ask if not provided)

1. **Design doc** (`.claude/specs/design-scope.md`) — the framing from `/design-initiative`
2. **Actors** — every person and system that touches the boundary
3. **Constraints** — team size and turnover, budget, deadlines, hard tech constraints
4. **Prior art** — existing systems, forks, or docs this builds on or replaces

## Document shape

Write `.claude/specs/design-requirements.md` with these sections. The numbering is the contract — reviews and
design records cite `§N`, so keep it stable.

| § | Section | Must contain |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Executive summary | Problem, proposed system, **recommendations marked as recommendations** — never present an unsettled roster or architecture as fact; §11's reviewers cannot approve a boundary §1 has already closed |
| 2 | Product principles | Each principle phrased as a **test that can fail**, not a slogan — include a graceful-degradation principle |
| 3 | Target system boundary | Identity root, **tenancy model** (the most expensive thing to get wrong), execution boundary |
| 4 | User experience requirements | Per-actor journeys (from design doc Phase 2), accessibility requirements, device context, information hierarchy — **Designer-led** |
| 5 | Workstream 1 | Screens, flows, states. Every "AI content must be distinguishable"-class requirement names the **data requirement** it implies |
| 6 | Workstream 2 | Services, data model, canonical entities, integrations |
| 7 | Workstream 3 | Model boundaries, deterministic fallbacks, shared registries, deployment topology |
| 8 | Responsibility matrix | Apply "**agents reason; services execute**" through each capability. Every reassignment from prior docs carries one sentence of rationale. Add a **does-not-own** column — the boundary an agent must not cross is as load-bearing as the one it owns |
| 9 | Platform registries | Skills, plugins, MCP catalog, policy, schema, model gateway. **Integrations are a governed catalog, not per-agent adapters** — see "Shared capability rule" below |
| 10 | Agent memory & knowledge | Working / episodic / semantic tiers, retrieval provenance fields, and the **promotion gate**: what it takes for run content to become durable shared knowledge |
| 11 | Critical flows | Step-by-step for anything irreversible (signing, sending, publishing). Server-generated timestamps and hashes stated explicitly |
| 12 | Migration / consolidation | Split **done** (residual cleanup) from **open** (genuinely unplanned) |
| 13 | Quality ladder | The Q0–Q5 table (below). Every level names **applies-to**, **gate status**, and an **owner** |
| 14 | Delivery plan | **Name the pilot**: one real user/org, one end-to-end slice, success criteria, date. Then Part → Workstream → deliverables, so each owner reads one row |
| 15 | Review checklist | What a reviewer must approve, mapped to sections that still leave them free to disagree |
| 16 | Open decisions | Flat list, **blocking decisions marked** with a target date and what they block |

## Workstreams are people, not topics

**§5–§7 are named owners.** A workstream with no name on it is a category, and categories
do not get delivered. Title each as `Workstream N — <Concern>: <NAME>`, and carry the same
three names into §14's delivery table so every owner can read exactly one row.

Derive the split from **who is accountable**, not from a tidy taxonomy. If two topic areas
land on one person, they are one workstream; if one topic has no owner, say `TBD` in the
title and file it in §16 — never let it read as owned. Three owners means three
workstreams, even when the topics would sort naturally into five.

Each workstream section ends with its own **acceptance criteria** — the conditions that
let that owner declare their stream done, phrased so they can fail.

## Shared capability rule

**Agents invoke approved operations through shared skills, plugins, and MCP servers; they
do not own separate implementations.** Every external system — CRM, calendar, email,
storage, search — is a platform capability in a governed registry, never an adapter that
one agent carries privately.

§9 names the registries and, for each, what "approved" means: the schema, the permission
scope, the preconditions, and the test that admits an entry. An integration with no
registry entry is not integrated, it is embedded — and embedded integrations fork the
contract once per agent.

Where a registry is the *target* rather than what exists today, say so per row. A registry
listed with no current entries is a plan; a registry listed as if populated is a lie the
next reader inherits.

## The Q0–Q5 quality ladder (§13)

Every level names what it applies to, whether it gates, and **who owns it**:

| Level | Check | Applies to | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q0 | Unit / schema / permission tests | Code, tools, RLS, structured outputs | Required |
| Q1 | Golden-set regression | Agents, prompts, retrieval, workflows | Required |
| Q2 | LLM-as-judge | Quality, relevance, completeness, groundedness | Required, calibrated against human labels |
| Q3 | **Adversarial / safety** | Prompt injection, tool abuse, data leakage | Required |
| Q4 | Human acceptance | High-impact workflows and UX | Required pre-production |
| Q5 | Production monitoring | Drift, errors, latency, cost, feedback | Continuous |

Two rules that survive review:

- **Q3 is the level nobody volunteers for — assign it by name.** A platform whose agents
  hold tool or MCP credentials and has no adversarial gate has an open hole, not a backlog
  item. Any PRD that reaches §13 without a Q3 owner is incomplete.
- **LLM judges are not the sole authority for high-impact actions.** Deterministic checks,
  permission checks, policy checks, and human approval stay authoritative where required.
  State this in §13 so a passing Q2 can never be read as sufficient on its own.

## Quality bars

- **Every "must" is testable or it is a wish.** If you cannot say how it fails, rewrite it.
- **Entities imply mechanisms.** A governance rule with no entity to enforce it is not a rule yet — name the entity.
- **Structured beats prose where anything downstream computes on it.** Milestones as rows, not paragraphs.
- **Defer expensive machinery behind a measured need** — vector search, knowledge graphs, registries. Name the measurement that would justify each.
- **Every quality level (Q0-Q5 ladder) names an owner.** The adversarial level is the one nobody volunteers for; assign it explicitly.
- **Memory promotion is a gate, not a side effect.** Agents must not silently promote run or conversation content into durable shared memory. Name what approves a promotion and what scopes it (organization, engagement, user permission, classification).
- **Every retrieved item carries provenance** — source, version, tenant/scope, document status. A recommendation whose evidence cannot be traced is unreviewable, so provenance is a schema requirement, not a UI nicety.
- **Separate the audit trail from agent telemetry.** An immutable operational/security trail answers "who did what, and can it be disputed"; agent-run telemetry answers "how did the model behave." Same table for both means retention and access rules collide.
- **Immutable events get their own entity.** Signatures, approvals, and stage transitions are records that must reject later writes — including from admins. If the doc says immutable but names no entity that enforces it, it is not immutable yet.

## Unrecoverable requirements get their own class

**Some requirements cannot be added later at any price.** Anything whose data is generated
by traffic — instrumentation, log fields, holdout and randomization slices, viewport
tracking, pre-registration — is recoverable only by *waiting again*. A missing column on a
served result set is not a gap; it is a permanently missing row.

Mark these **`UNRECOVERABLE`** in the requirement table, and for each one state:

1. **What ships it** — the *same commit* as the feature it observes, never a follow-up item.
   A separately-sequenced instrumentation item is an instrumentation item that slips.
2. **The complete field list**, enumerated. "Log the result set" is not a requirement;
   the specific version stamps and per-item fields are. (diskoe, 2026-08-24: T-0 shipped
   `BUILT` with 5 of 7 stamps and 5 of 9 per-item fields having **no column** — the
   contract said "logging exists", so nothing caught it.)
3. **What it costs to skip**, in units of time. Not "we lose data" — "we wait 90 days
   again."

**Then predict the descope.** (diskoe, 2026-08-24, §16 RK-2: viewport tracking was
*"usually the first thing cut for scope"* and the 5% randomization slice *deliberately
degrades results for 1-in-20 users* — both would "feel like reasonable trims in week
three." Naming the trim before it is proposed is the only mitigation that works, because
by week three the person proposing it will be right about everything except recoverability.)

## PARTIAL is a state, and it names its missing field

A binary built/not-built vocabulary cannot express the most common real outcome: the shape
shipped and the field list did not. Every requirement gets `ABSENT` / `PARTIAL` / `MET`,
and **`PARTIAL` is invalid unless it names the specific missing field or unmet criterion**.

Where this document and a build-state summary elsewhere disagree, **this document is the
stricter and correct one** — say so in the header, and say it in the other document too.
Two registries that both claim authority produce a repo where `BUILT` quietly means two
different things in two files. See `~/.claude/refs/verification.md` §2 for the
cross-cutting pattern.

## Designer contribution (§4 and throughout)

The Designer role is specifically accountable for:

- **§4 UX requirements** — not wireframes, but the constraints: what information density is acceptable, what the zero-data state looks like, what the error state communicates
- **§5 UI workstream** — interaction patterns, state management from the user's perspective
- **Accessibility throughout** — WCAG level, keyboard navigation requirements, screen reader considerations
- **Content design** — what the system says to users in each state (empty, loading, error, success)

### When a design artifact contradicts a requirement, the requirement wins

Exported screens are an artifact; a budget is a contract. (diskoe, 2026-08-24: an intake
shipped at **≥6 taps against a ≤4-tap, ≤20 s budget** (PR-1.1) because the Figma flow was
transcribed faithfully and nobody re-read the requirement — and **nothing measured taps
or elapsed time**, so it passed every gate, DC-3.)

- Any requirement with a **number in it** (taps, seconds, items, characters) names the
  test that measures it, in this document. A budget with no meter is a preference.
  See `~/.claude/refs/verification.md` §1 corollary: "every budget needs a meter."
- Where an exported screen and a stated budget disagree, file it as a contradiction with
  an ID and resolve it explicitly. The screen changes, or the budget is amended on the
  record — never a silent win for whichever one got implemented first.

### Enumerate the states no screen was exported for

Design sets cover the happy path and are thin exactly where the system is most often seen.
List the states per surface and mark which have a design and which are a **guess**:

- **The zero-state that every instance passes through first** — a dashboard with no
  engagements, a report before any data, a profile before any save. (diskoe, 2026-08-24:
  a zero-vote poll state had no export at all, RK-8 — the shipped fallback was invented at
  implementation time and recorded as a guess only after the fact.)
- Empty-because-filtered vs empty-because-broken. These must not render identically.
  (diskoe, 2026-08-24: a barrier-free filter needed a dedicated honest empty state, B-13a.)
- Partial-data, upstream-outage, and permission-denied. A **permission-denied path that
  renders as "no data" is the failure mode that survives longest**: RLS that blocks
  every anonymous read catalogue-wide makes the whole public surface read as "no events"
  rather than "no permission" (diskoe, 2026-08-24). This repo's Supabase RLS is the same
  stack — the defect is a live risk here, not an analogy.

A state that ships as a guess is fine. A state that ships as a guess and is *recorded as
a transcription* is the defect.

## HITL Gates

This skill has two mandatory pause points. Do not proceed past either without
explicit user approval.

### Gate 1 — PRD review

After writing `.claude/specs/design-requirements.md`:

1. Present a section-by-section summary (not the full doc — the user has the file open)
2. Call out every decision that was made vs deferred, and every `§16` open item
3. **Stop and ask:** "PRD is ready for review. Read through `.claude/specs/design-requirements.md`
   and let me know what to revise — or approve to proceed to HTML rendering."
4. Do NOT render HTML until the user approves

Park every unknown in §16 rather than guessing. A guess that passes review silently
is worse than a question that pauses it.

### Gate 2 — HTML Overview tab

After the user approves the PRD, render the **Overview tab only** into the design
record HTML (`docs/<project>-system-design.html`):

- If the HTML file does not exist, create it with the shell (tab bar, CSS tokens,
  hash router) and the Overview tab populated
- If it exists, update only the Overview tab content — do not touch other tabs
- The Overview tab contains: problem summary (compressed from §1), audience cards
  (from §4), shared-capability inventory (from §9), and the TOC skeleton

After rendering, confirm: "Overview tab rendered. The next stage is `/design-system`
to add Architecture and Components."

## Output

`.claude/specs/design-requirements.md`, tracked, with a status header:

```markdown
# PRD — <project name>
**Status:** Draft | In review | Ratified · <date>
**Reviewers:** <names>
**Design doc:** <path to upstream design doc>
```

## Boundary with `/design-system` and `/design-roadmap`

**The PRD spec and the design record HTML are separate artifacts with separate lifecycles.**
The PRD (`.claude/specs/design-requirements.md`) ratifies once and freezes; the HTML
(`docs/<project>-system-design.html`) is re-verified against the working tree at every
publish.

**The HTML is built incrementally across all three design skills:**

| Skill | Renders to HTML | After HITL gate on |
|---|---|---|
| `/design-product` | Overview tab | PRD spec |
| `/design-system` | Architecture + Components + Platform tabs | Component specs |
| `/design-roadmap` | Roadmap tab (milestones, delta, issues) | Draft issue backlog |

Each skill owns its tabs — it may update them on re-run but must not modify tabs owned
by another skill. The PRD's `§N` numbering is its stable API; the HTML cites it by
reference, never by embedding.

---

**Upstream:** `/design-initiative` — its design doc seeds §1, §3, and §4.

**Next step:** `/design-system` — the Architect takes this PRD and the design doc,
designs the system, and produces two artifacts: the HTML design of record and deep
component specs in `.claude/specs/`.
