# /design-initiative

Frame and scope the following into named initiatives: `$ARGUMENTS`

**The first design stage.** This is where a problem space becomes named work. The output
is a design doc — not a PRD, not a system design, not a backlog. Those come later.

## Pipeline position

```
/design-initiative (PM, EM, Des) → .claude/specs/design-scope.md: what we are building, why, initiative map
    ↓
/design-product (PM, EM, Des) → PRD: deliverables, requirements, constraints
    ↓
/design-system (Architect) → two outputs:
    docs/<project>-platform.html (design of record)
    specs/*.md (component build specs)
    ↓
/design-roadmap (PM, EM, Des) → milestones, dependencies, GitHub issues
    ↓
/workflow-triage → /workflow-build
```

No PRD is written without a design doc to scope from. No system design is drawn without
both a design doc and a PRD. No build begins without a design record.

## Target repo

A `repo:<path>` token in `$ARGUMENTS` targets a different repo; all repo-relative paths
and git/test commands resolve against it, and artifacts land in the TARGET repo. No token
→ the cwd's repo. If the cwd is not inside a project repo, ask rather than defaulting.

## Roles at the table

This skill runs as three roles collaborating:

| Role | Focus | Accountable for |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **PM** | Problem definition, user stories, scope boundaries | "Are we solving the right problem?" |
| **EM** | Technical feasibility, dependency ordering, team capacity | "Can we build this, and in what order?" |
| **Designer** | User journeys, information architecture, interaction patterns | "How does this feel to use?" |

All three voices appear in the output. A design doc that only has PM or only has EM is
incomplete — push for the missing perspective before finalizing.

## Inputs (ask if not provided)

1. **Problem statement** — who hurts, what they do today, what it costs
2. **Known failure modes** — 3-5 distinct ways the system currently fails (patterns, not symptoms)
3. **Existing assets** — prototypes, research, analogous systems, production metrics
4. **Actors** — every person and system that touches the boundary
5. **Constraints** — team size/turnover, budget, deadlines, hard tech constraints
6. **Scope boundary** — what is explicitly in vs out of MVP
7. **Dependencies** — what must exist elsewhere first

## Process

### Phase 0 — Read the tree before the docs

**Do this first, before Phase 1, and before trusting any table above.** Source documents
describe intent; the working tree is the only evidence of state. A prior project's PRD
inherited 🟢 markers from feasibility docs written before anyone read the code — **six of
eight were wrong** (diskoe, 2026-08-24, `design-requirements.md` verification block).
Ranking, intake, the review gate and the snapshot store were all marked shipped and did not
exist; the public Next.js surface existed and no document knew.

For every capability a source doc claims exists, find the file. Then record it as:

| Capability | Doc says | Tree says | File path or ABSENT |
|---|---|---|---|

Rules:

- **A capability with no file path is `ABSENT`, whatever the doc says.** Not 🟡, not
  "partial" — absent. "Shipped" claims decay silently; a path is the only claim that can
  be checked by the next reader.
- **`BUILT` means "the module exists and is tested", never "the deliverable is accepted."**
  Keep those two states in separate columns. (diskoe, 2026-08-24: intake was `BUILT` and
  simultaneously violated its own ≤4-tap budget, DC-3.)
- **The audit is the *first* deliverable, not a preamble.** Where it contradicts a source
  doc, the contradiction is a finding with an ID — not a silent correction, and not a
  reason to re-derive the doc.
- Anything you could not verify is `🔍 UNVERIFIED — go and look`, never an optimistic 🟡.

**A wrong build-state marker is more expensive than a missing one.** It removes work from
the plan that then never gets planned, and every downstream sequencing decision inherits
the error. See `~/.claude/refs/verification.md` §2 for the cross-cutting pattern.

### Phase 1 — Deconstruct

IDEO / Stanford d.school HMW methodology.

1. **Deconstruct** — problems, pain points, insights, opportunities. Table: Area | Finding | Implication.
2. **HMW statements** — reframe each finding as a How Might We question. Outcome-oriented, not solution-prescribing.
3. **Technical solutions** — for each HMW: what's required + concrete named technical approach.
4. **Workstream clustering** — group by WHO (FE), WHERE-BE, WHERE-AI, WHERE-data, WHY (observability), WHERE-Ops. Note cross-cluster items.
5. **Initiative definition** — 5-7 named initiatives. Each: name, one-sentence goal, components, roles, cross-initiative dependencies. First initiative has zero external deps.
6. **Dependency mapping** — visual artifact per initiative: cards with title, description, needs, enables, role badge. Color-coded by role.

### Phase 2 — User journeys (Designer-led)

For each initiative, before it is considered framed:

1. **Primary actors** — who interacts with this, what is their context (volunteer on day 2, staff managing 8 engagements, nonprofit filling a form)
2. **Key journeys** — step-by-step what the actor experiences, including wait states and failure paths
3. **Information architecture** — what does the actor need to see at each step, what decisions do they make, what feedback do they get
4. **Interaction constraints** — accessibility requirements, device context, time budget (a volunteer has 5 minutes, not 30)

### Quality constraints

- Be specific to the use case — no generic outputs that could apply to anything
- Use real numbers, benchmarks, and named tools where they exist
- Cite analogous systems or prior art
- If multilingual requirements exist, call them out as day-one decisions
- **A thesis nobody has tested is a risk, not a foundation.** If an initiative's value
  depends on an unrun experiment, the experiment is that initiative's first component and
  the initiative carries its failure branch. (diskoe, 2026-08-24: a relational thesis gated
  a whole workstream and had never been run — the honest planning outcome is "this may be a
  finding, not a feature," and the plan must survive that answer.)
- **Name what each initiative would look like if its premise fails.** An initiative with
  no failure branch has not been scoped; it has been assumed.

## Output

Write `.claude/specs/design-scope.md` — one per repo, tracked, no date in the filename. The `**Date:**`
line inside the doc carries the date; the file itself is overwritten in place so
downstream skills and reviewers always read one path.

**Next step:** `/design-product` — takes this design doc and produces the PRD
(deliverables, requirements, constraints). The design doc frames the problem;
the PRD defines what gets built.
